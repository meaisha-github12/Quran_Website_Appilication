Quran
This is the Quran Web Application, created with the help of JSP, Servlet, MYSQL, and APIs.
It begins by launching NewFile.jsp, which functions in essence as a sign-up page. The user will be able to log in on their own after successful registration. He needs to enter the right credentials for a successful login; otherwise, he won't be able to utilize the Quran web application.
All 144 of the Quran's surahs and Juzz are displayed on the homepage.
The user can read the entire Juzz of the Quran by clicking on the Read Juzz button, or he can read a surah with audio by clicking the Read Surah button. The home page consists of all 144 surahs and Juzz of the Quran.
If the user clicks on the Read Juzz button, he can read the full Juzz of the Quran, or if he clicks the Read Surah button, he can read a surah with audio.
